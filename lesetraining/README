start with roo shell, do steps as described here:
http://www.springsource.org/spring-roo and log.roo
do not run "mvn eclipse:eclipse", just import project with maven
then it should work in roo shell
run as mvn gwt:run or using "run as web app"
ignore error "Plugin execution not covered by lifecycle configuration: org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin:1.2:exec (execution: default, phase: process-classes)"
make sure you have unzipped C:\Users\mkessler\.m2\repository\com\google\appengine\appengine-java-sdk\1.8.1
make sure you have added jdk to eclipse.ini/sts.ini: -vm C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_01\bin\javaw.exe
try it on leseprogramm-new.appspot.com/ApplicationScaffold.html
make sure eclipse datanucleus and auto-enhancer is enabled for project or run "datanucleus enhancer setting"
run mvn gwt:run, but do not launch url, then run as google web app on a different port (otherwise spring-web is not available for some strange reason)
